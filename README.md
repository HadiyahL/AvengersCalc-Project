# AvengersCalc-Project

My first project incorporating HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
An semi-advanced calculator with a bit more functionality than a basic calculator.  
It is called AvengersCalc because the idea for this project came from my buddy group (CodeYourFuture WestMidlands Class1) after our second JavaScript 1 class.
The name of my buddy group is Coding Avengers &  
it consists of Shukri Ali (PD Mentor), Nadir (Education Mentor), Adebola Alaba-Ige, Davinder Singh, Denis-Andrei Peptanariu, Zubeda Khanum and myself, not forgetting our dear friend
a friend of the group Omolola Bello.
